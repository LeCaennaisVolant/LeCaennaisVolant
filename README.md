- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeCaennaisVolant
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Computational Chemistry (ie:  MM, MD, DFT, HF, etc.).
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program for Organic Chemistry, however I have determined that lab work is not for me and would like to pivot into a non-lab role. 
- I possess a strong theroetical background in Chemistry, as well as a math minor (taken up to Diff. Eq. I) from my education, and would like to explore 
- Computational Chemistry as an option.  
- 💞️  My interests include Chemistry (Physical and Organic), drug discovery, pharmacology, and foreign languages (I possess a DALF C1 certification through the Ministère 
- Française de l'Éducation Nationale et de la Jeunesse).
- 📫
